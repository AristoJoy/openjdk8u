// Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
//  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
//  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
//  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
//  were valid as well as the html file.)
// Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
//  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
//  AWT-core home page -> test areas and/or -> AWT team  for a list of
//  areas.
// Note also the 'ConstructorsNullTest.html' in the run tag.  This should
//  be changed to the name of the test.

 This is part of the standard test machinery.
 It creates a dialog (with the instructions), and is the interface
  for sending text messages to the user.
 To print the instructions, send an array of strings to Sysout.createDialog
  WithInstructions method.  Put one line of instructions per array entry.
 To display a message for the tester to see, simply call Sysout.println
  with the string to be displayed.
 This mimics System.out.println but works within the test harness as well
  as standalone.
