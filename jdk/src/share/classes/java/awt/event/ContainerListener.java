/**
 * The listener interface for receiving container events.
 * The class that is interested in processing a container event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>ContainerAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addContainerListener</code>
 * method. When the container's contents change because a component
 * has been added or removed, the relevant method in the listener object
 * is invoked, and the <code>ContainerEvent</code> is passed to it.
 * <P>
 * Container events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 * The AWT will automatically handle add and remove operations
 * internally so the program works properly regardless of
 * whether the program registers a {@code ContainerListener} or not.
