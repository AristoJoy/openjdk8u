/**
 * Signifies an argument used for both input and output in an invocation,
 * meaning that the argument is being passed from the client to
 * the server and then back from the server to the client.
 * <code>ARG_INOUT.value</code> is one of the possible values used to
 * indicate the direction in
 * which a parameter is being passed during a dynamic invocation
 * using the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).
 * <P>
 * The code fragment below shows a typical usage:
 * <PRE>
 *  ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
 *  org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue nv = orb.create_named_value(
 *        "argumentIdentifier", myAny, org.omg.CORBA.ARG_INOUT.value);
